**Using Power bi | Excel**
I successfully transformed and cleaned a 24,000-record car sales dataset in Excel, applying advanced formulas in Power BI. Key data columns include Car_id, Date, Customer details, Dealer information, and sales-related attributes. My analysis incorporated Year-over-Year (YoY), Month-to-Date (MTD), Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD), and Year-to-Date (YTD) comparisons. Metrics like sales differences and averages were calculated, and the findings were visually presented using Power BI for effective insights into car sales trends and performance.
